# Stock-Market-Simulator
Simple Stock Market Live Simulator


Old script I wrote a couple months back when Perl code wasn't on point... Anyways this is a workable stock-market simulator written in Perl, with HTML, JS and CSS (CGI). This was written awhile ago... When I was first learning AJAX and stuffs so it's not the cleanest code in the world. Anyways, I plan on finishing this or something... There might be a few files missing (pretty sure there are). But this is the basic backbone of it. I'll be updating this when I can :D (DOES NOT WORK LIKE REAL STOCK MARKET. It works how I percieve a stock market works? Though it's obviously a lot more complex than a few equations here.


Somewhat working live version:

Personal Portfolio (currently owned stocks)
http://ilankleiman.com/demo/stocks/stocks.pl?username=ilan&password=pass&hash=pass&method=portfolio

Stocks on the Stock Market to buy
http://ilankleiman.com/demo/stocks/stocks.pl?username=ilan&password=pass&hash=pass

And other links that I don't know/remember anymore. I'll be updating this readme etc.
Though, as of now I'm re-coding all of this from scratch. Updates will be placed into the folder "Beta" until complete, then I'll overwrite the current main stocks.pl with the latest one (once everything is done). So check out "Beta" folder until then!
