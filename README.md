# Stock-Market-Simulator
Simple Stock Market Live Simulator


Old script I wrote a couple months back when Perl code wasn't on point... Anyways this is a workable stock-market simulator written in Perl, with HTML, JS and CSS (CGI). This was written awhile ago... When I was first learning AJAX and stuffs so it's not the cleanest code in the world. Anyways, I plan on finishing this or something... There might be a few files missing (pretty sure there are). But this is the basic backbone of it. I'll be updating this when I can :D (DOES NOT WORK LIKE REAL STOCK MARKET. It works how I percieve a stock market works? Though it's obviously a lot more complex than a few equations here.
